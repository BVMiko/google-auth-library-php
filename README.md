## Description

This is Google's officially supported PHP client library for using OAuth 2.0
authorization and authentication with Google APIs.

## Alpha

This library is in Alpha. We will make an effort to support the library, but
we reserve the right to make incompatible changes when necessary.

### Installing via Composer

The recommended way to install Guzzle is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest stable version:

```bash
composer.phar require google/google-auth-library-php
```

## Application Default Credentials

This library provides an implementation of
[application default credentials][application default credentials] for PHP.

The Application Default Credentials provide a simple way to get authorization
credentials for use in calling Google APIs.

They are best suited for cases when the call needs to have the same identity
and authorization level for the application independent of the user. This is
the recommended approach to authorize calls to Cloud APIs, particularly when
you're building an application that uses Google Compute Engine.

## What about auth in google-apis-php-client?

The goal is for auth done by
[google-apis-php-client][google-apis-php-client] to be be performed
by this library. 

Eventually, google-apis-php-client should a dependency on this library.
At the moment, there is no ETA for this, a key prequisite being for google-apis-php-client 
itself take a dependency on [Guzzle][Guzzle] so that it can use the Guzzle
subscribers that this package provides. That's currently [being discussed](http://github.com/google/google-api-php-client#473).
This package's availability should make that transition simpler as there is one
less thing that need to be handled.
